It looks as though you have an opportunity to get in the cult's good graces by helping to clear out a threat. This may help you learn more about the \"Gloom\".",

He asked another favor of you in exchange for forgiveness for killing his brethren. The cultists want the necromancer, Jekserah, dead. If you bring her head to their headquarters, you may find out more about the \"Gloom\". The figure gave you details on where to find evidence of Jekserah's plans.",

He then introduced you to a black, flaming rift in space that he called his master, \"The Gloom\". The figure then promptly betrayed you by summoning a horde of unnatural creatures in an attempt to kill you. Apparently, getting back into the cult's good graces isn't easy after murdering their followers and setting back their plans. After an exhausting battle, the Gloom spoke to you in a cold, low voice. \"You have done well. My minions may not be able to forgive. But I can. Come. Come to me. Step into my realm. Embrace the inevitable.\" The rift stands before you. Do you dare enter?",
                8: "You stepped into the black rift. The low voice spoke once more, \"Tricked again. Truly amazing that creatures as stupid as yourselves have caused me so much trouble. No matter. You will rot here, completely cut off from your home. There will be no last stand. You will simply waste away. You will die without valor in a foreign place and there is no recourse. I leave you now forever. Good-bye.\" The ensuing battle seemed endless. After killing everything, you banged on the walls, desperately hoping for something to continue fighting against in this exile. You grew tired, then your vision darkened. In your next breath, you found yourself laying in the grass outside of the cult’s hideout. \"Know that I have spared you.\" The low voice returned. \"Your persistence intrigues me. I invite you to break yourself against me. It will be more entertaining than the last time I brought gloom to this world.\" You bolted upright and rushed back into the crypt. Dead bodies of the cultists littered the floor. \"I am not here anymore. These shells have served their purpose. My roots are now deep and you will soon encounter my endless power once more. I look forward to the day.\""

There is a diamond mine in the southern mountains overrun by Vermlings, with some other more intelligent force behind them. If you can fight your way in and grab the biggest diamond you can find, Jekserah will give you a considerable reward. However, you have been also been warned by a guard that Jekserah may have more sinister machinations than she lets on. Something about overthrowing the military... but one diamond couldn't hurt, could it?",
                2: "Sinister machinations or not, you decided the phrase \"considerable reward\" was more pertinent. As expected, the diamond mine was infested by Vermling miners. They were lead by a Merciless Overseer who swiftly turned the miners against you with a few cracks of his whip. Once the overseer was dealt with and the diamond recovered, the remaining miners scattered. You headed back to Jekserah to claim your reward. Her bodyguards escorted you inside the manor where you found her somehow different—more harrowed and grim. \"Wonderful.\" She exchanged the diamond for a large purse full of coins. \"This will serve beautifully as a focus for the incantations. I wonder if the cultists even knew what they had here. With this, I can summon an entire army of undead!\" She turned to you with a strange glint in her eye. \"So then! Are you ready to overthrow the military of Gloomhaven and put control of the city into the hands of the Merchant’s Guild? Or do you not have the stomach to effect real change?\"",
                3: "You decided that \"sinister machinations\" outweigh \"considerable reward\". You raided Jekserah's warehouse and uncovered her secret plans to invade the town with an army of the dead. In the process, she fled the city.

With the cultists and their minions dead, it seems the dark rift is now dormant. It is no less disconcerting, however. You tossed a rock at it, and the rock disappeared into nothingness. You must admit that you wonder whether you could enter the rift yourself and whether you could survive the trip to wherever that rock ended up. Do you dare enter the rift?",

Once the demons were dispatched, the voice spoke once more and invited you into it's realm. Having already made one leap of faith, you decided there was no harm in making another.

With all three vessels in hand, you made your way back to the mountain cave and into the Echo Chamber. You placed the small earthen pots in the center of the cavern and wait. It was difficult to notice at first, but, over time, a faint tremor in the floor and walls began to grow until it was difficult to even keep your footing. Then there was a flash of light, and before you floated a swirling green mist in the shape of many long, intertwined tendrils. “I had almost forgotten what it felt like to not be imprisoned.” For once you heard the Voice not from inside your own head, but emanating from the figure in front of you. “It is quite wondrous. I am sure that before too long, I will forget the horrid feeling of powerlessness. It is time to leave this realm,” the Voice said. “There is much to be remedied from my prolonged absence. But first, I must give you a proper thanks. I shall hold up my end of the bargain and bestow upon you great power and wealth.” The green light spreads forth and illuminated you, providing you with the most wonderful feeling of warmth. And then it was gone. All that was left was a stone tablet in the center of the room with strange, cryptic markings. Perhaps those marking may be useful in the future.",

Luckily, Inox don’t feel a particular need to cover their tracks. You are able to follow their trail deeper into the woods, where eventually you find a slave labor camp—Inox guards overseeing a group of ragged Orchids and humans working to construct catapults and other machines of war. The camp is not particularly well-guarded from intruders, and, after eliminating a couple key lookouts, you are able to slip into the slave pens and free one of the Orchids. He agrees to guide you through the forest, but only after helping him seek revenge against the Inox. You have little choice in the matter as he rushes one of the Inox. Once the last Inox falls, the Orchid thanks you. “They killed my family when they came.

Whatever creatures haunt these shadows, I cannot help you fight them, but if you survive, I will show you the way back.” As Redthorn disappears into the mist, you begin to see other forms moving at the edge of your vision. And then you hear the hoofbeats, like a terrible thunder rolling through the trees. The sound gets closer and closer until the ground beneath your feet tremors at the approach. The Dark Rider fades into and out of the mist seemingly at random. The monster is difficult to strike, but eventually the headless spectre screams as you land one final strike against it, and it's form dissipates in a gruesome way. Redthorn appears out of the thinning fog. “I don’t know how you did it, but I can already feel the forest lighten.

A voice booms out over the howling wind. “You are not welcome here, mortals. All that awaits you is the embrace of death.” You can hardly see through the blizzard, but you are determined to make sure death embraces someone else. As you battle though both enemies and weather alike, you escape the rising storm of ice to find some semblance of shelter in a cave. A glowing white orb sits behind the crytalline demons occupying the cave. The pieces all start to fall into place. They are controlling the weather here, blocking our passage to the peak. You destroy the orb and the screeching of the wind outside the cave lessens to a faint murmur. You exit to see clear skies above you and a path to the peak. At this altitude, without a cloud in sight, you find yourself looking out over the horizon, marveling at the wondrous expanse of mountains and the forests and plains beyond them.

You are very close to the peak now, and you surmise that this development has something to do with the evil presence at the summit. A sharp screeching rings out, and you crouch down squinting through the darkness. Near the peak you see many dark shapes scrabbling and writhing, as if the mountain itself is alive. Squinting further, you notice that the writhing is moving down the mountain toward you. It seems your presence has not gone unnoticed. You ready your weapons and prepare to fight your way to the peak. You make your way through the dark fog and find a small clearing at the summit. The screech once again pierces your ears, and a massive demon with a multitude of sharp claws and leathery wings lands before you. “You dare approach my nest?” You can barely make out the words from its high-pitched wailing. “I will harvest your corpses and feed them to my children!” You battle the demon and its 'children' until finally, the demon can take no more. The giant demon screeches one last time, its timbre and intensity modulating wildly as it spasms in its death throes. Not wanting to get close to its flailing claws, you wait for the creature to expire. When it finally does, a stillness washes over the area and day once again breaks in the sky above. The view is grand, apart from the blood and carnage that litters the peak. You take it all in and then slowly begin to make your way back down the mountain, satisfied that whatever evil was lurking here will no longer trouble Gloomhaven."

I used it to imprison one of my greatest foes—a being of death and hatred. I do not know what will happen when you bring that thing to my chamber, but I can guarantee you no good will come of it!” Shut up shut up shut up shut up SHUT UP! You blocked the Voice’s lies from your mind and before the Voice could speak another word, you raised up the scepter and channeled its power. A black fog oozed from it and enveloped you. The Voice screamed out once more, but there was no coherence in the sound—only pain. The fog began to dissipate and, for a moment, you felt relief, until you saw that you were not in the Echo Chamber anymore, but some dark and hostile realm instead. The Voice rang out again, but somehow it was different: “The power of the Voice is mine! You will be the first I destroy with it!” And try it did, but after a fierce battle, you severed the Voice's vocal chords. The Voice will never speak again."

The battle is still long and difficult, as more forces continue to arrive from the elemental plane, but it ultimately only brings the residents of Gloomhaven into stronger unison, fighting against a common enemy. And with you no longer fighting for them, the demon force eventually relents and retreats back to its own plane. The next weeks are difficult, as the citizenry rebuilds the walls and everything else that had been destroyed in the prolonged battle. They also need time to trust you again after your ill-conceived betrayal. But Gloomhaven does bounce back in time. It is full of resilient people and the port is vital for trade. It never feels quite the same afterward, but at some point, it at least still feels like home."

You have visited at least one of these locations and destroyed the corrupting influence within. If you seek out and destroy the corrupting influence in all three locations, Hail may be to provide more information on the corruption permeating Gloomhaven's surrounding area.",
                2: "You have destroyed the corrupting influence in the Misty Sea, Dagger Forest, and Copperneck Mountains. It's time to go see Hail and get to the bottom of all this.",
                3: "Before Hail could explain anything, a massive column of black sand erupts from northeast the crooked bone. Hail resolutely points you toward the whirling mass of sand, handing you a pouch to protect you from its ill effects. Entering the vortex is immensely painful but the pouch fills you with a dull numbness. Eventually, you find yourself standing in a large stone room covered in odd runic symbols. There is an unearthly coldness to it, and the dull pain of the Void persists. “Those brave enough to enter here will be the first torn apart.” An arresting voice echoes through the chamber around you. “The rest I will hunt down like game and devour, but I do think I will enjoy this more.” As your eyes adjust to the low light, you see a shadowy form in the center of the room. With time, you are able to focus on the image of an Aesther with two long, thin blades. “I have waited many years to reap this harvest,” he says with a wicked grin. “At one time, I had convinced myself that I would find more delight in watching you slowly kill yourselves, but with my meddling brethren and the deaths of my wards, I have returned to my original design. “I am not unhappy at the development. Even the patience of an immortal has its limits.” The Aesther flashes its blades in a mesmerizing dance. “Come then, brave lambs. Who will be the first to embrace the Gloom?” The battle rages for what feels like eons, but finally, two swords fall to the stone floor with a sharp ring. The Aesther stands limp, a look of shock on his wounded face. “How dare you,” he mutters. The voice that was once smooth and hypnotic is now gravely and dark. “I have waited thousands of years, and you presume to rob me of the fruits of my labors?” The Aesther’s mouth drops slack in death, but still the figure stands, as if held up by invisible strings. “You can destroy my vessel and banish me from this plane, but it will never be enough. I am eternal. I will return. I will feast on this world once again!” At this, the body of the Aesther crumples to the ground and fades out of existence. The dull pain subsides, and you ascend the staircase to a bright, clear sky. The tremors and vortex of black sand are gone and all those gathered around the Void look very relieved when you emerge from the confrontation. You let the people know that whatever calamity had descended upon them has now been averted. They cheer and celebrate your strength."

The writing upon them was in some unknown archaic language. Among the scrolls, you found a map of the northern countryside. A bend in the Still River was clearly marked as a point of interest. Contemplating whether you want to find out more about this so-called \"Gloom,\" you decided that the spot could be a point of interest for you, as well.",

Among the scripts found in the ritual chamber are notes on a couple of other places of power in the area. One is marked as being overrun by vicious undead. It looks as though you have an opportunity to get in the cult's good graces by helping to clear out a threat. This may help you learn more about the \"Gloom\".",
                3: "After the terrible shrieks and moans of the undead ceased, a grinning hooded figure appeared before you. His demeanor was deeply unsettling. He asked another favor of you in exchange for forgiveness for killing his brethren. The cultists want the necromancer, Jekserah, dead. If you bring her head to their headquarters, you may find out more about the \"Gloom\". The figure gave you details on where to find evidence of Jekserah's plans.",
                4: "You have slain Jekserah. As she collapsed, the life fleeing her eyes, she whispered at you “You have no idea what’s coming...”. Perhaps your old boss's head may prove useful in future dealings with the bandits.",

He then introduced you to a black, flaming rift in space that he called his master, \"The Gloom\". The figure then promptly betrayed you by summoning a horde of unnatural creatures in an attempt to kill you. Apparently, getting back into the cult's good graces isn't easy after murdering their followers and setting back their plans. After an exhausting battle, the Gloom spoke to you in a cold, low voice. \"You have done well. My minions may not be able to forgive. But I can. Come. Come to me. Step into my realm. Embrace the inevitable.\" The rift stands before you. Do you dare enter?",
                8: "You stepped into the black rift. The low voice spoke once more, \"Tricked again. Truly amazing that creatures as stupid as yourselves have caused me so much trouble. No matter. You will rot here, completely cut off from your home. There will be no last stand. You will simply waste away. You will die without valor in a foreign place and there is no recourse. I leave you now forever. Good-bye.\" The ensuing battle seemed endless. After killing everything, you banged on the walls, desperately hoping for something to continue fighting against in this exile. You grew tired, then your vision darkened. In your next breath, you found yourself laying in the grass outside of the cult’s hideout. \"Know that I have spared you.\" The low voice returned. \"Your persistence intrigues me. I invite you to break yourself against me. It will be more entertaining than the last time I brought gloom to this world.\" You bolted upright and rushed back into the crypt. Dead bodies of the cultists littered the floor. \"I am not here anymore. These shells have served their purpose. My roots are now deep and you will soon encounter my endless power once more. I look forward to the day.\""

Kurz bevor sie durch das Fenster entwischte verriet sie euch, dass sie mit einer Heerschar von Untoten zurückkommen würde.

In den südlichen Bergen gibt es eine Diamantenmine, die von Ratzen überrannt wurde, hinter der eine andere, intelligentere Macht steht. Wenn ihr euch hineinkämpft und den größten Diamanten den ihr finden könnt schnappt, wird euch Jekserah eine beträchtliche Belohnung geben. Ihr wurdet jedoch auch von einer Wache gewarnt, dass Jekserah möglicherweise noch finsterere Machenschaften hat, als sie zugibt. Etwas über den Sturz des Militärs... aber ein Diamant kann ja nicht schaden, oder?",

Wie erwartet wurde die Diamantenmine von Ratzen-Minenarbeitern in Beschlag genommen. Sie wurden von einem gnadenlosen Aufseher angeführt, der die Minenarbeiter mit ein paar Peitschenhieben schnell gegen euch aufbrachte. Nachdem der Aufseher ausgeschaltet und der Diamant geborgen worden war, verstreuten sich die verbliebenen Bergleute. Ihr seid zu Jekserah zurückgekehrt, um eure Belohnung einzufordern. Ihre Leibwächter begleiteten euch ins Innere des Herrenhauses, wo ihr sie irgendwie verändert vorfandet - gequälter und grimmiger. \"Wunderbar.\" Sie nahm den Diamanten und gab euch einen großen Beutel voller Münzen. \"Er wird sich bestens für die Beschwörungen eignen. Ob die Kultisten wohl wussten, was da in ihrem Besitz war? Damit kann ich eine ganze Armee von Untoten herbeirufen! \"Sie wandte sich mit einem seltsamen Funkeln  in den Augen an euch. \"Nun gut!

Then there was a flash of light, and before you floated a swirling green mist in the shape of many long, intertwined tendrils. “I had almost forgotten what it felt like to not be imprisoned.” For once you heard the Voice not from inside your own head, but emanating from the figure in front of you. “It is quite wondrous. I am sure that before too long, I will forget the horrid feeling of powerlessness. It is time to leave this realm,” the Voice said. “There is much to be remedied from my prolonged absence. But first, I must give you a proper thanks. I shall hold up my end of the bargain and bestow upon you great power and wealth.” The green light spreads forth and illuminated you, providing you with the most wonderful feeling of warmth.

You shake your head and attempt to guard yourself from the negative feelings. You didn’t swallow those throat-crushing breathing spheres and swim down to the bottom of the ocean just to fail now. You must destroy this threat. You steel your nerves and set to the creature with your blades. With the giant eye dead, all of its minions wither and die with it. Thankfully, the room stops shaking as well. You can’t get out the way you came in, but you are able to explore the structure further, free of the crushing dread that permeated the air previously.

It is a scene of massacre and devastation. Burned out buildings and disfigured corpses. Judging from the wounds, you figure a raiding party of Inox did this. Luckily, Inox don’t feel a particular need to cover their tracks. You are able to follow their trail deeper into the woods, where eventually you find a slave labor camp—Inox guards overseeing a group of ragged Orchids and humans working to construct catapults and other machines of war. The camp is not particularly well-guarded from intruders, and, after eliminating a couple key lookouts, you are able to slip into the slave pens and free one of the Orchids. He agrees to guide you through the forest, but only after helping him seek revenge against the Inox. You have little choice in the matter as he rushes one of the Inox. Once the last Inox falls, the Orchid thanks you. “They killed my family when they came. They said my children were not strong enough workers.” He introduces himself as Redthorn and agrees to take you deeper into the forest.",

Safe and perfect. And then it came. Now this place houses nothing but horrors and nightmares.” The Orchid looks down at the black earth. “Truly, this place terrifies me. Whatever creatures haunt these shadows, I cannot help you fight them, but if you survive, I will show you the way back.” As Redthorn disappears into the mist, you begin to see other forms moving at the edge of your vision. And then you hear the hoofbeats, like a terrible thunder rolling through the trees. The sound gets closer and closer until the ground beneath your feet tremors at the approach. The Dark Rider fades into and out of the mist seemingly at random. The monster is difficult to strike, but eventually the headless spectre screams as you land one final strike against it, and it's form dissipates in a gruesome way. Redthorn appears out of the thinning fog. “I don’t know how you did it, but I can already feel the forest lighten. It will take a long time, but I think the heart of the forest may one day be restored."

A voice booms out over the howling wind. “You are not welcome here, mortals. All that awaits you is the embrace of death.” You can hardly see through the blizzard, but you are determined to make sure death embraces someone else. As you battle though both enemies and weather alike, you escape the rising storm of ice to find some semblance of shelter in a cave. A glowing white orb sits behind the crytalline demons occupying the cave. The pieces all start to fall into place. They are controlling the weather here, blocking our passage to the peak. You destroy the orb and the screeching of the wind outside the cave lessens to a faint murmur. You exit to see clear skies above you and a path to the peak. At this altitude, without a cloud in sight, you find yourself looking out over the horizon, marveling at the wondrous expanse of mountains and the forests and plains beyond them. You can even see the faint outline of Gloomhaven in the distance.",

You are almost enjoying yourself, admiring the view of the entire countryside, when the view grows suddenly dark, despite it only being midday. You are very close to the peak now, and you surmise that this development has something to do with the evil presence at the summit. A sharp screeching rings out, and you crouch down squinting through the darkness. Near the peak you see many dark shapes scrabbling and writhing, as if the mountain itself is alive. Squinting further, you notice that the writhing is moving down the mountain toward you. It seems your presence has not gone unnoticed. You ready your weapons and prepare to fight your way to the peak. You make your way through the dark fog and find a small clearing at the summit. The screech once again pierces your ears, and a massive demon with a multitude of sharp claws and leathery wings lands before you. “You dare approach my nest?” You can barely make out the words from its high-pitched wailing. “I will harvest your corpses and feed them to my children!” You battle the demon and its 'children' until finally, the demon can take no more. The giant demon screeches one last time, its timbre and intensity modulating wildly as it spasms in its death throes. Not wanting to get close to its flailing claws, you wait for the creature to expire. When it finally does, a stillness washes over the area and day once again breaks in the sky above. The view is grand, apart from the blood and carnage that litters the peak. You take it all in and then slowly begin to make your way back down the mountain, satisfied that whatever evil was lurking here will no longer trouble Gloomhaven."

I used it to imprison one of my greatest foes—a being of death and hatred.

You blocked the Voice’s lies from your mind and before the Voice could speak another word, you raised up the scepter and channeled its power. A black fog oozed from it and enveloped you. The Voice screamed out once more, but there was no coherence in the sound—only pain. The fog began to dissipate and, for a moment, you felt relief, until you saw that you were not in the Echo Chamber anymore, but some dark and hostile realm instead. The Voice rang out again, but somehow it was different: “The power of the Voice is mine!

                2: "Maybe there was something to those guard's word after all. You helped oust the demons and install a different set of overlords into Gloomhaven.",
                3: "Following the directions given by the dying guard, you are able to easily locate the rebel camp. The poor fool thought you would join with the rebels to help overthrow the demons, but such hopes were childish and unfounded. You are here to kill and destroy. Without hesitation, you rampage through the camp in the foothills of the Watcher Mountains. You set fire to their tents and slay anyone who stands before you. The last battalion of guards hesitates as it faces you, then the humans turn and flee. “Arm the siege weapon!” One of them calls as they crest the hill. You give chase. This should be interesting. Fighting through the first wave of soldiers, you arrive at a clearing. The rest of the guards are standing around a very large mechanical cannon. The guards fire the cannon at you many times, but you endure the volleys and slay the guards as you advance. Eventually, the cannon lies ruined and broken at your feet, and with it, any hope the rebels had of assaulting Gloomhaven. The guards who are still alive scatter, and you return to the demon-ruled Gloomhaven victorious. “So you have crushed the pathetic upstarts?” You stand before one of the Prime Demon’s liaisons. “Good. You have proven yourselves an incredibly effective tool, and my master will compensate you greatly for your service.”"

Help us take back the city from those demons. Head east, to the border of the Watcher Mountains. Look to the north of the ash tree grove. Talk with the commander. Help free the city...”{br}Hmm. Working for a Demon hasn't been all it was cracked up to be. It might just be time to join the rebel alliance.",
                2: "But then again, neither was working with a bunch of loser rebels. Instead, you helped oust the demons and install an entirely different set of overlords into Gloomhaven.",
                3: "But then again, neither was working with a bunch of loser rebels. You used the guard's directions to locate the rebel base and slaughtered them all.",
                4: "You follow the dead guard’s directions into the foothills of the Watcher Mountains. Not to kill and destroy, but to help. The rebels seem wary at first, but they eventually open up. \"You could be our secret weapon. If you could take the armory of the Ghost Fortress just as we break through the north wall, we could then converge at the fortress and make our stand there. Once we are properly armed and have you at our side, the demons won’t stand a chance. Most of the citizenry are unhappy under their occupation and will rise up when they see we have the advantage.” Three days later you sneak into the Ghost Fortress, and storm the armory. You secure the last of the armory stock just as the rebel fighters break through into the fortress. Cleaning out the demons from the rest of the building becomes short work after that. With a strong foothold in the town and the populace on your side, the tide quickly turns against the demons. The battle is still long and difficult, as more forces continue to arrive from the elemental plane, but it ultimately only brings the residents of Gloomhaven into stronger unison, fighting against a common enemy. And with you no longer fighting for them, the demon force eventually relents and retreats back to its own plane. The next weeks are difficult, as the citizenry rebuilds the walls and everything else that had been destroyed in the prolonged battle. They also need time to trust you again after your ill-conceived betrayal. But Gloomhaven does bounce back in time. It is full of resilient people and the port is vital for trade. It never feels quite the same afterward, but at some point, it at least still feels like home."

If you seek out and destroy the corrupting influence in all three locations, Hail may be to provide more information on the corruption permeating Gloomhaven's surrounding area.",

                3: "Before Hail could explain anything, a massive column of black sand erupts from northeast the crooked bone. Hail resolutely points you toward the whirling mass of sand, handing you a pouch to protect you from its ill effects. Entering the vortex is immensely painful but the pouch fills you with a dull numbness. Eventually, you find yourself standing in a large stone room covered in odd runic symbols. There is an unearthly coldness to it, and the dull pain of the Void persists. “Those brave enough to enter here will be the first torn apart.” An arresting voice echoes through the chamber around you. “The rest I will hunt down like game and devour, but I do think I will enjoy this more.” As your eyes adjust to the low light, you see a shadowy form in the center of the room. With time, you are able to focus on the image of an Aesther with two long, thin blades. “I have waited many years to reap this harvest,” he says with a wicked grin. “At one time, I had convinced myself that I would find more delight in watching you slowly kill yourselves, but with my meddling brethren and the deaths of my wards, I have returned to my original design. “I am not unhappy at the development. Even the patience of an immortal has its limits.” The Aesther flashes its blades in a mesmerizing dance. “Come then, brave lambs. Who will be the first to embrace the Gloom?” The battle rages for what feels like eons, but finally, two swords fall to the stone floor with a sharp ring. The Aesther stands limp, a look of shock on his wounded face. “How dare you,” he mutters. The voice that was once smooth and hypnotic is now gravely and dark. “I have waited thousands of years, and you presume to rob me of the fruits of my labors?” The Aesther’s mouth drops slack in death, but still the figure stands, as if held up by invisible strings. “You can destroy my vessel and banish me from this plane, but it will never be enough. I am eternal. I will return. I will feast on this world once again!” At this, the body of the Aesther crumples to the ground and fades out of existence. The dull pain subsides, and you ascend the staircase to a bright, clear sky. The tremors and vortex of black sand are gone and all those gathered around the Void look very relieved when you emerge from the confrontation. You let the people know that whatever calamity had descended upon them has now been averted. They cheer and celebrate your strength."
